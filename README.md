# nelmaliki.github.io

This is a static site hosted through github pages. The static artifacts are generated by next.js via npm run build. /app contains the source code for this project. Every route for the website is a folder, where the top level of /app is the index page. Page.tsx is how to render the route.

The build process puts the static artifacts into the out directory. Github workflow actions compile the app into a /out directory and hosts the website with it. Do not check in /out.

For local development run "npx serve out" from the root directory.
