# Advanced Markdown Features Test Post

This is a **completely fictional** test post designed to stress-test the markdown renderer with various advanced features.

## Complex Tables

### Performance Comparison Matrix

| Feature | Basic Mode | Pro Mode | Enterprise |
|---------|------------|----------|------------|
| **Speed** | 100 ops/sec | 500 ops/sec | 2,000 ops/sec |
| **Accuracy** | 95% | 99.5% | 99.9% |
| **Cost** | $10/month | $50/month | $200/month |
| **Support** | Email only | 24/7 Chat | Dedicated Rep |

### Multi-level Headers Test

## H2: Secondary Section  
### H3: Tertiary Section
#### H4: Quaternary Section
##### H5: Quinary Section
###### H6: Senary Section

## Code Blocks in Multiple Languages

### Python Implementation
```python
def quantum_fibonacci(n):
    """Calculate Fibonacci using quantum superposition (totally fake)"""
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    
    # Fake quantum operations
    qubit_a = QuantumBit(0)
    qubit_b = QuantumBit(1)
    
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        qubit_temp = qubit_a + qubit_b
        qubit_a = qubit_b
        qubit_b = qubit_temp
    
    return qubit_b.collapse()
```

### JavaScript Configuration
```javascript
const advancedConfig = {
  renderEngine: 'quantum-markdown-v2',
  features: {
    tables: true,
    codeHighlighting: true,
    mathRendering: false,
    mermaidDiagrams: false
  },
  performance: {
    lazyLoading: true,
    cacheEnabled: true,
    maxRenderTime: 5000
  }
};
```

### Shell Commands
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Fictional deployment script
echo "Deploying to quantum servers..."
kubectl apply -f quantum-deployment.yaml
kubectl rollout status deployment/quantum-app
echo "Deployment complete!"
```

## Lists and Formatting

### Nested Lists with Mixed Types

1. **Primary Tasks**
   - [ ] Initialize quantum matrix
   - [x] Configure temporal buffers
   - [ ] Calibrate probability generators
   
2. **Secondary Objectives**
   - Implement error correction
     - Quantum error detection
     - Classical fallback systems
   - Performance optimization
     1. Memory usage reduction
     2. Processing speed improvement
     3. Energy efficiency gains

3. **Tertiary Goals**
   - Documentation updates
   - Team training sessions

### Definition Lists

**Quantum Computing**
: A type of computation that harnesses quantum mechanical phenomena

**Superposition** 
: The ability of a quantum system to be in multiple states simultaneously

**Entanglement**
: A quantum phenomenon where particles become interconnected
