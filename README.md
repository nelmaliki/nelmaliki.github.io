# nelmaliki.github.io

This is a static site hosted through github pages. The static artifacts are generated by next.js via npm run build inside the src folder. src/app contains the source code for this project. Every route for the website is a folder, where the top level of /app is the index page. Page.tsx is how to render the route.

The build process puts the static artifacts into the client directory which is where github pages looks for its files.

For local development run "npx serve client" from the root directory.
